# Breast-cancer-prediction-model
The breast cancer prediction model I developed represents a comprehensive approach to assessing and predicting outcomes for individuals diagnosed with this condition. The journey began with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, where I meticulously examined and processed the available data, gaining insights into the crucial variables that influence breast cancer prognosis.

Utilizing the power of machine learning, I employed a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict whether an individual diagnosed with breast cancer would survive. This predictive model utilized various factors and characteristics derived from the dataset to classify whether the person is likely to be alive or not based on their diagnosis and other pertinent features.

Furthermore, I implemented a linear regression model that leveraged the identified variables to estimate the projected lifespan of individuals diagnosed with breast cancer. This regression analysis aimed to provide valuable insights into how long a person might live after being diagnosed, considering the interplay of different contributing factors.

The predictive power of these models not only helps in determining the likelihood of survival post-diagnosis but also offers a quantitative estimation of the expected lifespan. This comprehensive approach intends to aid healthcare professionals and researchers in making informed decisions regarding treatment plans, patient care, and further research directions in the field of breast cancer.
